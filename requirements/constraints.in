# Version constraints for pip-installation.

# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# edX as an organization is not yet fully upgraded to Py3.
django<2.0

# Newer versions of these packages would require django 2.0.0.
django-guardian==2.0.0
mysqlclient==1.3.14

# Pinned due to bug in 1.7.0 - 1.7.1 (https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/4692)
sphinx==1.6.7

# PyYAML<=4 has a security flaw (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-18342)
pyyaml>=5.1

# Required for django-user-tasks compatibility.
celery<4.0

# edx-lint==1.3.0 doesn't declare requirements correctly.
# edx-lint==1.4.0 requires astroid version incompatible with transifex-client.
# edx-lint==1.3.1 works, but we also need to manually pin a compatible astroid.
# Future versions of edx-lint will hopefully remove the need for these pins.
edx-lint==1.3.1
astroid==1.5.3
