# Unlike the other .txt files in this directory,
# this is a human-written file to constrain the version
# of pip-tools (the package that installs `pip-compile` and
# `pip-sync`, which are used in `make upgrade` and
# `make requirements`, respectively).
#
# Because different versions of pip-tools may generate
# and install requirements differently, we pin pip-tools
# here in order to keep requirement generation/installation
# deterministic.
#
# Feel free to manually bump this version as deemed appropriate.

pip-tools==4.0.0
